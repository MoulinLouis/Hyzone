# Common Styling

## Common UI Styling Library

This document describes the shared UI components and styles defined in `Common.ui`.

---

### Styles

We are providing some styles that can be re-used in any custom UI that, provide a cohesive UI experience with the core game UI. These styles are available in the `Common.ui` file.

You can find a list of all the styles defined with live examples by running the `/ui-gallery` command ingame.

<Callout type="warning">
  This command is not available yet, but will be in a future patch.

### Importing

To use these styles in your UI file:

```
$Common = "Common.ui";

// Then reference styles and components:
$Common.@TextButton { @Text = "My Button"; }
$Common.@Container { ... }
```

<Callout type="info">
The `Common.ui` file is at `Common/UI/Custom/Common.ui` within the Hytale pack. If your custom ui document is in a subfolder of `Common/UI/Custom/`, reference it via relative path traversal:

```
$Common = "../Common.ui";
```

You can find more info about paths [here](markup#path).
